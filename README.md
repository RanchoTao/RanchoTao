I am a passionate self-taught full-stack developer, open source maintainer, and contributor.

I was born in Beijing in 2005 and I majored in electrical engineering and automation in college.

I will continue to maintain my projects and contribute to the open source community.

I hope to make a positive impact through technology and open source!

Thank you very much for your support!
